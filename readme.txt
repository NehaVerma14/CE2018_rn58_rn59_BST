This is the work of DSA LAB 3 and 4 . Both the Linked list implementation and the array list implementation is done by Neha Verma (59).
Here Binary Search Tree is implemented using array and linked list. Some basic operations like insertion, deletion, searching, traversals etc are implemented with arrays as well as linked lists.
